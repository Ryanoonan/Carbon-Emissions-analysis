# Carbon-Emissions-analysis

Download the original dataset: https://ourworldindata.org/co2-dataset-sources

Small SQL project to analyze carbon emissions. Sorts the dataset by removing non-country entities, and then returns the country with the maximal carbon emissions for each year.

The results of this querry are as follows:
United Kingdom led carbon emissions: 1750-1887 and 1889
United States led the carbon emissions: 1888 and 1890-2005
China led the carbon emissions: 2006-2022

These results align naturally with the history of these great powers. China emitting more since 2006 likely follows from the increase in sustainability practices from the US in recent years.
